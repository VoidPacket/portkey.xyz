<p>In today’s networking environments, Network Address Translation (NAT) plays a crucial role in connecting devices and maintaining network security. This article will explore what NAT is, the different types of NAT, and how it is used in various network scenarios.
What is Network Address Translation (NAT)?</p>
<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used by routers to translate private (non-routable) IP addresses within a local network to a single public IP address before sending traffic to the internet. NAT helps conserve the number of public IP addresses an organization needs, enhances security by masking internal IP addresses, and allows multiple devices to share a single public IP.
Why is NAT Important?</p>
<h3 id="nat-is-essential-for-several-reasons">NAT is essential for several reasons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Address Conservation:</strong> With the limited availability of IPv4 addresses, NAT helps extend the life of IPv4 by allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By translating private IP addresses to a public IP, NAT helps obscure internal network structures, adding a layer of security against potential attackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified Network Management:</strong> NAT simplifies network management by reducing the need for complex routing schemes and allowing devices to be added or removed without affecting the global IP address space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-nat">Types of NAT</h3>
<p>NAT can generally be categorized into three main types: <strong>Source NAT (SNAT)</strong>, <strong>Destination NAT (DNAT)</strong>, and <strong>Port Address Translation (PAT)</strong>. Each serves a different purpose in network address translation and is used in various scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Source NAT (SNAT):</strong> Source NAT is a method of translating private IP addresses to public IP addresses when traffic is sent from an internal network to the internet. It is often used for one-to-one translations, where a single private IP address is mapped to a single public IP address. This is useful when a device within a private network needs a consistent public IP for outbound connections. There is also an alternative option called Port Address Translation (PAT), which allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, and this will be covered in a separate bullet point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Destination NAT (DNAT):</strong> Destination NAT is used to translate a public IP address to a private IP address, directing traffic from an external network to a specific server or service within a private network. DNAT is commonly applied to inbound connections, such as when external users need to access a web server hosted inside a private network. By mapping the public IP address to the internal IP of the server, DNAT ensures the server is accessible from outside the network while keeping its internal IP address hidden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port Address Translation (PAT)</strong> also known as <strong>NAT Overload:</strong> PAT is a variation of Source NAT that allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address by using different ports for each session. This method efficiently maximizes the use of limited public IP addresses, making it ideal for home and small business networks where multiple devices need internet access simultaneously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-pat-work">How Does PAT Work?</h3>
<p>Let’s look at a typical scenario with NAT:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Outbound Traffic:</strong> When a device on the private network initiates a connection to the internet, the NAT-enabled router translates the device’s private IP address to the router’s public IP address, appending a unique port number to distinguish multiple devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inbound Traffic:</strong> For incoming responses, the router uses the port number to determine the destination device on the private network and translates the public IP address back to the original private IP address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-use-cases-for-nat">Common Use Cases for NAT</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Home and Small Office Networks:</strong> NAT is extensively used in home and small office routers to enable multiple devices to share a single internet connection, avoiding the need for a public IP address for each device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate Networks:</strong> Enterprises often use NAT to connect their private internal networks to the public internet securely. It allows companies to use a single public IP address, reducing the cost and complexity of managing multiple public IPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Centers and Cloud Providers:</strong> NAT is widely used in data centers and cloud environments to map internal IP addresses to public IPs, facilitating secure and scalable internet access for virtual machines and services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Network Address Translation is a fundamental networking technology that supports IP address conservation, enhances security, and simplifies network management. By understanding the different types of NAT and their use cases, network engineers can effectively design and implement network solutions that meet the needs of today’s dynamic environments.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the world of network engineering, <em>DHCP</em> <em>(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</em> is a crucial service that makes our lives a lot easier. But what exactly is DHCP, and how does it work? Let&rsquo;s dive into the details and explore the ins and outs of this essential network service.
What is DHCP?</p>
<p><strong>DHCP</strong> stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It&rsquo;s a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. Without DHCP, network administrators would need to manually assign IP addresses to every device on the network, which can be both time-consuming and prone to errors.
How DHCP Works</p>
<h2 id="dhcp-operates-based-on-a-client-server-model-heres-a-step-by-step-breakdown-of-the-process-often-referred-to-as-the-dora-process">DHCP operates based on a client-server model. Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step breakdown of the process, often referred to as the DORA process:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery:</strong> When a device connects to a network, it sends out a DHCPDISCOVER message to find any available DHCP servers. This message is broadcast to all devices on the network because the client doesn&rsquo;t yet have an IP address to target a specific server.</li>
<li><strong>Offer:</strong> Upon receiving the DHCPDISCOVER message, DHCP servers respond with a DHCPOFFER message. This offer includes an IP address, subnet mask, lease duration, and other relevant configuration information.</li>
<li><strong>Request:</strong> The client receives multiple offers but will choose one and respond with a DHCPREQUEST message. This message is sent as a broadcast to inform all servers that the client has accepted an offer from a specific server.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> The chosen DHCP server responds with a DHCPACK message, finalizing the IP address assignment and providing any additional configuration options. The client is now configured to communicate on the network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ip-assignment-options-static-ip-dhcp-lease-and-dhcp-reservation">IP Assignment Options: Static IP, DHCP Lease, and DHCP Reservation</h2>
<p>There are three main methods for assigning IP addresses on a network:</p>
<p><strong>Static IP:</strong> This involves manually configuring a device with a fixed IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pros:</em> Ensures a specific IP address, beneficial for servers and network devices.</li>
<li><em>Cons:</em> Labor-intensive and prone to human error.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DHCP Lease:</strong> This is the standard DHCP assignment where IP addresses are dynamically assigned and managed by the DHCP server.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pros:</em> Simplifies IP address management, reduces configuration errors, and efficiently utilizes IP address space.</li>
<li><em>Cons:</em> IP addresses can change, which might be unsuitable for some devices like servers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DHCP Reservation:</strong> This method allows a DHCP server to assign a specific IP address to a device based on its MAC address.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pros:</em> Combines the benefits of dynamic management with the consistency of a static IP.</li>
<li><em>Cons:</em> Requires initial setup and maintenance but much easier than full static IP management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-can-dhcp-be-set-up">Where Can DHCP Be Set Up?</h2>
<p>DHCP services can be hosted in various locations within a network:</p>
<p><strong>Router:</strong> Many home and small office routers come with built-in DHCP server functionality. This is most likely how the network in your home works, with the router provided by your ISP acting as a DHCP server. It&rsquo;s the simplest and most common setup for small networks.</p>
<p><strong>Firewall:</strong> For more advanced networks, firewalls that serve as network gateways can also provide DHCP services, centralizing network management and adding an extra layer of security.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Server:</strong> In larger and more complex networks, a dedicated server, such as a Windows Server with the DHCP server role, offers more advanced features and greater scalability. This is typically used in enterprise environments where there is a need for robust and scalable network solutions.</p>
<h2 id="key-dhcp-scope-settings">Key DHCP Scope Settings</h2>
<p>When configuring a DHCP server, you&rsquo;ll need to define a scope—a range of IP addresses that the server can assign to clients. Key settings within a DHCP scope include:</p>
<p><strong>IP Address Range:</strong> The range of IP addresses available for assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Subnet Mask:</strong> Defines the network and host portions of an IP address.</p>
<p><strong>Lease Duration:</strong> The length of time an IP address is assigned to a device before it must renew the lease.</p>
<p><strong>Default Gateway:</strong> The IP address of the router or gateway that devices should use to access other networks.</p>
<p><strong>DNS Servers:</strong> IP addresses of the DNS servers that clients should use for domain name resolution.</p>
<h2 id="additional-dhcp-options">Additional DHCP Options</h2>
<p>Besides the basic scope settings, DHCP servers can be configured with various other options to enhance network functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Option 66:</em> Specifies a Boot Server Host name. This is a TFTP Server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Option 150:</em> Provides a list of TFTP servers, useful for VoIP phones and other devices requiring configuration files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Option 119:</em> Defines domain search suffixes, allowing clients to search multiple domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Option 42:</em> Specifies the Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers. This ensures that all devices on the network have synchronized time settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Option 43:</em> Used for vendor-specific information, often for configuring IP phones, wireless access points, or other network devices requiring specific instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Option 252:</em> Provides the URL for a web proxy auto-discovery protocol (WPAD) script. This helps devices automatically discover and configure proxy settings for web access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Option 33:</em> Provides a list of static routes that the DHCP client should use, allowing more complex routing configurations without manual setup on each device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Understanding DHCP and its components can greatly simplify network management, reduce errors, and improve overall efficiency. Whether you&rsquo;re setting up a small home network or managing a large enterprise environment, DHCP is an indispensable tool in your networking toolkit.</p>
<p>By grasping the concepts of DHCP, the DORA process, different IP assignment methods, and various configuration options, you&rsquo;ll be well-equipped to handle any network configuration challenge that comes your way.</p>

            <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into something that&amp;rsquo;s at the core of how the internet works: BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol. If you’ve ever wondered how data finds its way across the globe, BGP is a big part of that magic. Think of BGP as the postal service of the internet. Just like how postal services route your mail through various cities to get it to its destination, BGP routes data between different networks.</description>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into something that&rsquo;s at the core of how the internet works: <strong>BGP</strong>, or <em>Border Gateway Protocol</em>. If you’ve ever wondered how data finds its way across the globe, BGP is a big part of that magic. Think of BGP as the postal service of the internet. Just like how postal services route your mail through various cities to get it to its destination, BGP routes data between different networks.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-bgp-work">How Does BGP Work?</h2>
<p>Imagine the internet as a massive collection of networks, each like a neighborhood. These neighborhoods are called Autonomous Systems (AS). Each AS could be an internet service provider (ISP), a university, a business, or any entity that operates a network.</p>
<p>BGP is the protocol these ASes use to talk to each other. When data needs to travel from one AS to another, BGP helps decide the best path.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how BGP operates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Establishing a BGP Connection:</strong> The first step is to establish a BGP connection with your peer router. This connection, known as a BGP session, is set up between BGP routers (also called BGP speakers) in different ASes for eBGP or within the same AS for iBGP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuring Route Advertisements:</strong> Next, you configure which routes you want to advertise to your peer. This could include specific networks within your AS that you want others to know about. You also decide which routes you want to redistribute from other routing protocols into BGP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agreeing on Accepted Routes:</strong> You then work with your peer to agree on what routes you will accept from them. This can be the full routing table, a summarized version, or just the default route, depending on your network requirements and policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establishing Additional BGP Peers:</strong> You repeat the process with any other BGP peers you have. Each peer connection adds to the pool of routing information available to your network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Routing Table:</strong> Once all BGP peers are configured, you obtain an initial routing table. BGP then uses various metrics and attributes to decide the preferred routes. Some key metrics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>AS Path:</em> The number of ASes a route must traverse. Shorter AS paths are preferred.</li>
<li><em>Next-Hop:</em> The IP address to which packets should be forwarded.</li>
<li><em>Local Preference:</em> A value set within an AS to prefer one path over another.</li>
<li><em>Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED):</em> Suggests preferred entry points into an AS when multiple paths exist.</li>
<li><em>Weight:</em> Cisco-specific attribute that influences route preference locally on the router where it is configured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Routing Table Updates:</strong> BGP routers continually update their routing tables based on information received from their peers. For example, if one of your BGP peers loses a route to a specific network, it sends an update. BGP evaluates the new information and modifies the routing table to reflect the best available path.</p>
<p><em>Example Scenario:</em> Suppose you have two BGP peers. Peer A loses its route to Network X. Peer A sends an update indicating this loss. BGP will then check if Peer B has a route to Network X. If Peer B has a valid route, BGP updates the routing table to prefer Peer B&rsquo;s path. This ensures that data can still reach Network X despite the loss of the route through Peer A.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-bgp-important">Why is BGP Important?</h2>
<p>Without BGP, the internet would be a series of isolated networks with no way to communicate effectively. BGP enables global connectivity by ensuring data packets find their way from source to destination, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>BGP is also crucial for the resilience and reliability of the internet. Since BGP routers continually update their routing tables and share information with neighboring routers, they can quickly adapt to changes in the network. If a particular path becomes unavailable due to an outage or maintenance, BGP can reroute traffic through an alternative path, ensuring minimal disruption. This dynamic adaptability is vital for maintaining the high availability and robustness we expect from the internet.</p>
<p>Additionally, BGP plays a significant role in traffic engineering and policy control. Network administrators can use BGP to influence routing decisions based on business policies, such as preferring certain routes for cost savings or performance reasons. This level of control allows organizations to optimize their network performance and manage their internet traffic efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-bgp-ibgp-and-ebgp">Types of BGP: iBGP and eBGP</h2>
<p>BGP comes in two main flavors: Internal BGP (iBGP) and External BGP (eBGP). While both serve the same fundamental purpose of routing data, they operate in different contexts and have distinct characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="internal-bgp-ibgp">Internal BGP (iBGP)</h3>
<p>iBGP is used for routing within a single Autonomous System (AS). It helps maintain a consistent routing table across all routers in the AS. Here&rsquo;s how iBGP works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Mesh Topology:</strong> In iBGP, every router must establish a session with every other iBGP router within the AS. This ensures that routing information is consistently shared across the network. For larger networks, this can become complex, so techniques like route reflectors and confederations are used to simplify the topology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Same AS Number:</strong> All routers in an iBGP setup use the same AS number. This helps in maintaining a uniform routing policy across the entire network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Next-Hop Change:</strong> By default, iBGP does not change the next-hop attribute when advertising routes to other iBGP peers. This means the original next-hop remains intact, ensuring accurate path information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="external-bgp-ebgp">External BGP (eBGP)</h3>
<p>eBGP is used for routing between different Autonomous Systems. It’s what enables different networks across the globe to communicate. Here&rsquo;s a closer look at eBGP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Connections:</strong> eBGP sessions are typically established between routers that are directly connected, often through physical links or dedicated connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Different AS Numbers:</strong> Routers in an eBGP session use different AS numbers. This distinction helps in identifying the boundaries between different networks and applying appropriate routing policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Next-Hop Change:</strong> By default, eBGP changes the next-hop attribute when advertising routes to ensure that the data can correctly traverse through multiple ASes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-the-distinction-matters">Why the Distinction Matters</h4>
<p>Understanding the difference between iBGP and eBGP is crucial for network design and management. iBGP ensures that all routers within an AS have a consistent view of the network, which is essential for internal traffic engineering. On the other hand, eBGP enables different ASes to exchange routing information, facilitating global internet connectivity.</p>
<p>Using both iBGP and eBGP allows networks to be scalable, resilient, and efficiently managed. Network administrators can apply specific policies and optimizations tailored to internal and external routing requirements, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>BGP is like the unsung hero of the internet. It works behind the scenes to keep everything connected and running smoothly. Next time you browse the web, remember there&rsquo;s a complex yet fascinating protocol ensuring your data gets where it needs to go.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once Ollama is installed we need to pull a model to use. I am going to use llama3 for this example but you can find many more listed here <a href="https://ollama.com/library">https://ollama.com/library</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ollama pull llama3
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once the model finishes pulling you can run the model with the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ollama run llama3

<p>From here you can treat this like a local CLI version of chatGPT or any other AI you may have used previously. I asked llama3 to tell me a fun fact about the Roman Empire, heres what it returned.</p>

    <img src="/img/ollama_funfact1.png"  alt="Ollama example"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>If you want to only utilize Ollama from the CLI, you are done and can stop here, but if you want a nicer user experience or to provide this local AI to other users, it would be much easier to do so with a web interface!</p>
<h3 id="open-webui-installation">Open webui installation</h3>
<p>The web interface we are going to be utilizing is a great open source tool called <strong>Open webui</strong> This runs on the same server as our Ollama instance, and infact calls to it and utilizes the models you have pulled down. We will be utilizing the recommended option of a Docker instance and following the information found hin the open webui documentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/">https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/</a></p>
<p>But, before we can start with the Open Webui installation, we need to install Docker. Docker has a nice set of documentation as well walking us through removing old conflicting packages, to installing the latest version of Docker in our Ubuntu server.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/</a></p>
<p>To remove all conflicting out of date packages, we will run the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> sudo apt-get remove $pkg; <span style="color:#66d9ef">done</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>after that is finished running we need to set up Docker&rsquo;s apt repository and add it into our apt sources.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Add Docker&#39;s official GPG key:</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt-get update
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once you have the Docker apt repository added into your apt source, you can install the latest version of Docker.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After Docker finishes installing you can run this command to verify it is working as expected. This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it will print a confirmation message and then exit.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo docker run hello-world
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that we have Docker&rsquo;s latest version installed on our Ubuntu server and confirmed it is functioning, we can proceed with the Open webui documentation. This should be relativeley quick as we are running Open webui on the same server as Ollama. We will be utilizing their recommended command to deploy the docker container to port 8080.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once this is running you should be able to reach your new Open webui Interface by browsing to your server IP port 8080 and be greeted with the Open webui login screen.</p>

    <img src="/img/open_webui.png"  alt="Open webui login page"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>Since this is your first time connecting to Open webui you will need to create a user account. The good news is that the first account created on the Open webui instance is the admin account. Also no data will leave your server, This is all explained in their FAQ.</p>

    <img src="/img/open_webui_FAQ_data.png"  alt="Open Webui FAQ"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>I will ask the same example question on the web interface that we used for the CLI test. Lets learn another fun fact about the Roman Empire!</p>

Among these, trunk ports play a crucial role in managing network traffic efficiently and securely. In this post, we&rsquo;ll delve into what a trunk port is, how it differs from an access port, and its importance in network infrastructure. We&rsquo;ll also cover best practices for configuring trunk ports to ensure optimal security and performance.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-trunk-port">What is a Trunk Port?</h3>
<p>A trunk port is a type of switch port that is designed to carry traffic for multiple VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) across the network. Unlike access ports, which only carry traffic for a single VLAN, trunk ports can handle traffic from multiple VLANs simultaneously. This makes them essential for interconnecting switches and other network devices in a VLAN-segmented network.
Trunk Ports vs. Access Ports</p>
<h4 id="understanding-the-difference-between-trunk-and-access-ports-is-crucial-for-effective-network-design">Understanding the difference between trunk and access ports is crucial for effective network design:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Port:</strong> An access port connects a switch to end devices like computers, printers, or IP phones. It carries traffic for a single VLAN, which simplifies the network configuration for end devices that do not need to distinguish between VLANs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trunk Port:</strong> A trunk port, on the other hand, connects switches to each other or to other network devices that need to manage traffic from multiple VLANs. It tags the traffic with VLAN identifiers, allowing different VLANs to coexist on the same physical link.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="uses-of-trunk-ports">Uses of Trunk Ports</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplinks to Other Switches:</strong> Trunk ports are commonly used for connecting switches to one another. This allows VLAN traffic to be carried across multiple switches, maintaining VLAN segmentation throughout the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplinks to Access Points:</strong> In wireless networks, trunk ports are used to connect switches to wireless access points (APs). This is crucial for supporting multiple SSIDs (each mapped to different VLANs), ensuring that wireless clients are properly segmented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuring-trunk-ports-for-security">Configuring Trunk Ports for Security</h4>
<p>Proper configuration of trunk ports is essential for maintaining network security and performance. Here are some best practices:</p>
<p><strong>Restrict VLANs:</strong> By default, a trunk port can carry traffic for all VLANs. However, it&rsquo;s a best practice to restrict the VLANs allowed on a trunk port to only those that are necessary. This minimizes the risk of VLAN hopping attacks and reduces unnecessary traffic on the link.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk allowed vlan &lt;VLAN_IDs&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>VLAN Pruning:</strong> VLAN pruning is a technique used to limit the number of VLANs that can travel over a trunk link. By default, a trunk port can carry traffic for all VLANs, but this can lead to unnecessary traffic and potential security risks. VLAN pruning ensures that only the VLANs required for a particular trunk link are allowed to send traffic across it.
How VLAN Pruning Works</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where you have three VLANs: VLAN 10, VLAN 20, and VLAN 30. Suppose you have two switches, Switch A and Switch B, connected via a trunk port. However, devices on Switch B only need access to VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. Without VLAN pruning, the trunk port would still carry traffic for VLAN 30, even though it&rsquo;s not needed on Switch B.</p>
<p>With VLAN pruning, you can configure the trunk port to only allow traffic for VLANs 10 and 20, effectively blocking VLAN 30 from using that trunk link. This reduces unnecessary traffic and minimizes the risk of VLAN hopping attacks, where an attacker could potentially access VLANs they&rsquo;re not supposed to.
Configuring VLAN Pruning</p>
<p>To configure VLAN pruning, you would typically specify which VLANs are allowed on a trunk port. Here’s an example command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, only VLANs 10 and 20 are allowed on the trunk link, while VLAN 30 is pruned off.</p>
<p><strong>Native VLAN:</strong> Ensure that the native VLAN (the VLAN for untagged traffic) is properly configured. Avoid using VLAN 1 as the native VLAN since it is the default and could be a target for attacks. Assign a different, unused VLAN as the native VLAN.
The Importance of Using an Unused VLAN for the Native VLAN</p>
<p>The native VLAN is the VLAN that carries untagged traffic on a trunk port. By default, this is VLAN 1, which can pose a security risk for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Target for Attacks:</strong> Since VLAN 1 is the default VLAN on most network devices, it is a common target for attackers. If an attacker gains access to VLAN 1, they could potentially disrupt or intercept untagged traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast Storms:</strong> Using VLAN 1 as the native VLAN increases the risk of broadcast storms, which can lead to network congestion and outages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Traffic:</strong> VLAN 1 often carries management traffic, making it more susceptible to being targeted in attacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Use an Unused VLAN</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it’s a best practice to assign an unused VLAN as the native VLAN. For example, if you have VLANs 10, 20, and 30 in use, you could assign VLAN 99 as the native VLAN:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk native vlan <span style="color:#ae81ff">99</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This approach reduces the risk of VLAN hopping and ensures that your critical VLANs are protected.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk native vlan &lt;VLAN_ID&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Disable DTP: Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) can automatically negotiate trunking on a port. For security reasons, it&rsquo;s advisable to disable DTP and manually configure trunking to prevent unauthorized devices from becoming trunks.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport mode trunk
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport nonegotiate
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Trunk ports are a fundamental component in VLAN-segmented networks, enabling the efficient and secure transport of traffic between switches and other network devices. By understanding the differences between trunk and access ports and following best practices for configuration, you can enhance both the performance and security of your network infrastructure. Remember, the goal is to maintain a streamlined, secure, and efficient network that meets the needs of your organization.</p>

            <description>VLAN stands for Virtual Local Area Network. Think of it as a way to segment a physical network into smaller, isolated parts without needing separate physical switches for each segment. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a bunch of invisible walls inside your network that can help organize and secure your traffic.
Why Use VLANs? Organization: Imagine your office building. Without VLANs, it’s like having no cubicles or offices—just one giant room where everyone’s talking over each other.</description>

<p>VLAN stands for <strong>Virtual Local Area Network</strong>. Think of it as a way to segment a physical network into smaller, isolated parts without needing separate physical switches for each segment. It&rsquo;s like having a bunch of invisible walls inside your network that can help organize and secure your traffic.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-vlans">Why Use VLANs?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Organization</strong>: Imagine your office building. Without VLANs, it’s like having no cubicles or offices—just one giant room where everyone’s talking over each other. With VLANs, you can separate departments (like HR, Sales, and IT) so each has its own space to communicate without interference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: VLANs add an extra layer of security by isolating sensitive data. For example, you can keep your HR department’s traffic separate from the rest of the network, reducing the risk of sensitive information leaking out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: By controlling and managing network traffic more effectively, VLANs can reduce congestion and improve overall performance. It’s like having dedicated lanes on a highway for different types of vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-vlans-work">How Do VLANs Work?</h3>
<p>In simple terms, VLANs tag network traffic with an identifier (VLAN ID) that tells your network devices how to handle it. Devices that belong to the same VLAN can communicate with each other as if they were on the same physical network, even if they’re not.</p>
<h3 id="real-life-example">Real-Life Example</h3>
<p>Let’s say you’re setting up a network for a small company. You could create one VLAN for the office staff, another for the guest Wi-Fi, and a third for the IP phones. This way, the guest Wi-Fi traffic doesn’t interfere with your office’s internal communications, and the IP phones have a dedicated path, ensuring call quality remains high.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>VLANs might sound a bit techy at first, but they’re a fundamental tool for creating a more organized, secure, and efficient network. Whether you&rsquo;re setting up a small home network or a large enterprise system, VLANs can make a big difference.</p>

<p>AI has become a significant force in the market, reshaping how people perceive technology. While I enjoy using AI models to craft images and descriptions for my D&amp;D group, immortalizing our adventures, my interaction with AI has been limited to this recreational use. Professionally, as a network engineer, my involvement with AI models is mostly limited to drawing inspiration from them for new ideas, or getting help rewording my emails and other communications. However, recently, I’ve delved into understanding how network design differs for AI farms and the rationale behind using different technologies or hardware setups.</p>
<h4 id="rdma">RDMA</h4>
<p>Let me introduce you to <strong>RDMA</strong>, which stands for Remote Direct Memory Access. RDMA bypasses the CPU and other traditional data access methods, pulling information directly from memory and transmitting it to the server array for model training. This technology is crucial as AI models are highly sensitive to packet loss, hence requiring a lossless approach. InfiniBand is another approach to this problem. While it’s intriguing, it relies on proprietary hardware not commonly found in most companies’ existing infrastructure. Consequently, setting up an AI deployment becomes significantly more expensive due to the need to acquire specific network hardware.</p>
<h4 id="roce">RoCE</h4>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a solution: <strong>RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet)</strong>. Essentially, RoCE offers the benefits of RDMA, such as bypassing the CPU and reducing latency, but can be implemented using existing Ethernet infrastructure. While this is an appealing option, there isn’t a standardized industry framework for it as far as I know. It remains to be seen which technology will prevail and steer the direction of the industry.</p>
<h4 id="comparing-technologies-and-connectivity-requirements">Comparing Technologies and Connectivity Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>InfiniBand (IB)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity Requirement</strong>: Layer 2</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: InfiniBand is a high-performance, low-latency networking technology primarily used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RoCE Versions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>RoCE v1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity Requirement</strong>: Layer 2</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: RoCE v1 relies on Ethernet frames and requires the network devices to be within the same Ethernet broadcast domain (i.e., the same VLAN/subnet).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RoCE v2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity Requirement</strong>: Layer 3</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: RoCE v2 encapsulates the RDMA traffic within UDP/IP packets, allowing it to traverse IP networks. This version supports layer 3 connectivity, meaning it can operate across different subnets and routed networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>I’m particularly interested in the infrastructure aspect of AI, which aligns closely with my career experiences. I’ll be closely monitoring developments in this area in the future. I’m looking forward to the day when I can set up a miniature version of these setups in my homelab and conduct real-world tests comparing the benefits of RoCE versus the classic Spine and Leaf design without AI-specific protocols. Given the rapid pace of industry evolution, that day might arrive sooner than expected.</p>
