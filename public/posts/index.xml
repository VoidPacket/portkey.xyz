            <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into something that&amp;rsquo;s at the core of how the internet works: BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol. If you’ve ever wondered how data finds its way across the globe, BGP is a big part of that magic. Think of BGP as the postal service of the internet. Just like how postal services route your mail through various cities to get it to its destination, BGP routes data between different networks.</description>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into something that&rsquo;s at the core of how the internet works: <strong>BGP</strong>, or <em>Border Gateway Protocol</em>. If you’ve ever wondered how data finds its way across the globe, BGP is a big part of that magic. Think of BGP as the postal service of the internet. Just like how postal services route your mail through various cities to get it to its destination, BGP routes data between different networks.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-bgp-work">How Does BGP Work?</h2>
<p>Imagine the internet as a massive collection of networks, each like a neighborhood. These neighborhoods are called Autonomous Systems (AS). Each AS could be an internet service provider (ISP), a university, a business, or any entity that operates a network.</p>
<p>BGP is the protocol these ASes use to talk to each other. When data needs to travel from one AS to another, BGP helps decide the best path. Here’s a simple breakdown of the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Path Selection:</strong> BGP doesn’t just pick any route. It looks for the most efficient path, considering factors like the number of hops (how many networks the data must pass through) and policy rules set by network administrators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routing Table Updates:</strong> BGP routers maintain a table of paths to various networks. They constantly update these tables based on information from other BGP routers. This ensures they always know the best path to send data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advertising Routes:</strong> Each AS advertises its presence and the networks it can reach to its neighboring ASes. This way, everyone knows which paths are available and can make informed routing decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-bgp-important">Why is BGP Important?</h2>
<p>Without BGP, the internet would be a series of isolated networks with no way to communicate effectively. BGP enables global connectivity by ensuring data packets find their way from source to destination, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>BGP is also crucial for the resilience and reliability of the internet. Since BGP routers continually update their routing tables and share information with neighboring routers, they can quickly adapt to changes in the network. If a particular path becomes unavailable due to an outage or maintenance, BGP can reroute traffic through an alternative path, ensuring minimal disruption. This dynamic adaptability is vital for maintaining the high availability and robustness we expect from the internet.</p>
<p>Additionally, BGP plays a significant role in traffic engineering and policy control. Network administrators can use BGP to influence routing decisions based on business policies, such as preferring certain routes for cost savings or performance reasons. This level of control allows organizations to optimize their network performance and manage their internet traffic efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-bgp-ibgp-and-ebgp">Types of BGP: iBGP and eBGP</h2>
<p>BGP comes in two main flavors: Internal BGP (iBGP) and External BGP (eBGP). While both serve the same fundamental purpose of routing data, they operate in different contexts and have distinct characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="internal-bgp-ibgp">Internal BGP (iBGP)</h3>
<p>iBGP is used for routing within a single Autonomous System (AS). It helps maintain a consistent routing table across all routers in the AS. Here&rsquo;s how iBGP works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Mesh Topology:</strong> In iBGP, every router must establish a session with every other iBGP router within the AS. This ensures that routing information is consistently shared across the network. For larger networks, this can become complex, so techniques like route reflectors and confederations are used to simplify the topology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Same AS Number:</strong> All routers in an iBGP setup use the same AS number. This helps in maintaining a uniform routing policy across the entire network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Next-Hop Change:</strong> By default, iBGP does not change the next-hop attribute when advertising routes to other iBGP peers. This means the original next-hop remains intact, ensuring accurate path information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="external-bgp-ebgp">External BGP (eBGP)</h3>
<p>eBGP is used for routing between different Autonomous Systems. It’s what enables different networks across the globe to communicate. Here&rsquo;s a closer look at eBGP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Connections:</strong> eBGP sessions are typically established between routers that are directly connected, often through physical links or dedicated connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Different AS Numbers:</strong> Routers in an eBGP session use different AS numbers. This distinction helps in identifying the boundaries between different networks and applying appropriate routing policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Next-Hop Change:</strong> By default, eBGP changes the next-hop attribute when advertising routes to ensure that the data can correctly traverse through multiple ASes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-the-distinction-matters">Why the Distinction Matters</h4>
<p>Understanding the difference between iBGP and eBGP is crucial for network design and management. iBGP ensures that all routers within an AS have a consistent view of the network, which is essential for internal traffic engineering. On the other hand, eBGP enables different ASes to exchange routing information, facilitating global internet connectivity.</p>
<p>Using both iBGP and eBGP allows networks to be scalable, resilient, and efficiently managed. Network administrators can apply specific policies and optimizations tailored to internal and external routing requirements, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>BGP is like the unsung hero of the internet. It works behind the scenes to keep everything connected and running smoothly. Next time you browse the web, remember there&rsquo;s a complex yet fascinating protocol ensuring your data gets where it needs to go.</p>

<p>If you want to only utilize Ollama from the CLI, you are done and can stop here, but if you want a nicer user experience or to provide this local AI to other users, it would be much easier to do so with a web interface!</p>
<h3 id="open-webui-installation">Open webui installation</h3>
<p>The web interface we are going to be utilizing is a great open source tool called <strong>Open webui</strong> This runs on the same server as our Ollama instance, and infact calls to it and utilizes the models you have pulled down. We will be utilizing the recommended option of a Docker instance and following the information found hin the open webui documentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/">https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/</a></p>
<p>But, before we can start with the Open Webui installation, we need to install Docker. Docker has a nice set of documentation as well walking us through removing old conflicting packages, to installing the latest version of Docker in our Ubuntu server.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/</a></p>
<p>To remove all conflicting out of date packages, we will run the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> sudo apt-get remove $pkg; <span style="color:#66d9ef">done</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>after that is finished running we need to set up Docker&rsquo;s apt repository and add it into our apt sources.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Add Docker&#39;s official GPG key:</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt-get update
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once you have the Docker apt repository added into your apt source, you can install the latest version of Docker.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After Docker finishes installing you can run this command to verify it is working as expected. This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it will print a confirmation message and then exit.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo docker run hello-world
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that we have Docker&rsquo;s latest version installed on our Ubuntu server and confirmed it is functioning, we can proceed with the Open webui documentation. This should be relativeley quick as we are running Open webui on the same server as Ollama. We will be utilizing their recommended command to deploy the docker container to port 8080.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once this is running you should be able to reach your new Open webui Interface by browsing to your server IP port 8080 and be greeted with the Open webui login screen.</p>

    <img src="/img/open_webui.png"  alt="Open webui login page"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>Since this is your first time connecting to Open webui you will need to create a user account. The good news is that the first account created on the Open webui instance is the admin account. Also no data will leave your server, This is all explained in their FAQ.</p>

    <img src="/img/open_webui_FAQ_data.png"  alt="Open Webui FAQ"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>I will ask the same example question on the web interface that we used for the CLI test. Lets learn another fun fact about the Roman Empire!</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>As you explore the web interface, you&rsquo;ll notice a wealth of options at your disposal. I encourage you to experiment and learn what each feature does. The flexibility and customization options can significantly enhance your user experience. Additionally, take the time to explore the Ollama library. It offers a variety of models, each with unique capabilities. Trying out different models can help you find the perfect fit for your specific needs. Embrace this opportunity to expand your knowledge and creativity with your new AI setup!</p>

In this post, we&rsquo;ll delve into what a trunk port is, how it differs from an access port, and its importance in network infrastructure. We&rsquo;ll also cover best practices for configuring trunk ports to ensure optimal security and performance.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-trunk-port">What is a Trunk Port?</h3>
<p>A trunk port is a type of switch port that is designed to carry traffic for multiple VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) across the network. Unlike access ports, which only carry traffic for a single VLAN, trunk ports can handle traffic from multiple VLANs simultaneously. This makes them essential for interconnecting switches and other network devices in a VLAN-segmented network.
Trunk Ports vs. Access Ports</p>
<h4 id="understanding-the-difference-between-trunk-and-access-ports-is-crucial-for-effective-network-design">Understanding the difference between trunk and access ports is crucial for effective network design:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Port:</strong> An access port connects a switch to end devices like computers, printers, or IP phones. It carries traffic for a single VLAN, which simplifies the network configuration for end devices that do not need to distinguish between VLANs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trunk Port:</strong> A trunk port, on the other hand, connects switches to each other or to other network devices that need to manage traffic from multiple VLANs. It tags the traffic with VLAN identifiers, allowing different VLANs to coexist on the same physical link.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="uses-of-trunk-ports">Uses of Trunk Ports</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplinks to Other Switches:</strong> Trunk ports are commonly used for connecting switches to one another. This allows VLAN traffic to be carried across multiple switches, maintaining VLAN segmentation throughout the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplinks to Access Points:</strong> In wireless networks, trunk ports are used to connect switches to wireless access points (APs). This is crucial for supporting multiple SSIDs (each mapped to different VLANs), ensuring that wireless clients are properly segmented.</p>
</li>

<p>Proper configuration of trunk ports is essential for maintaining network security and performance. Here are some best practices:</p>
<p><strong>Restrict VLANs:</strong> By default, a trunk port can carry traffic for all VLANs. However, it&rsquo;s a best practice to restrict the VLANs allowed on a trunk port to only those that are necessary. This minimizes the risk of VLAN hopping attacks and reduces unnecessary traffic on the link.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk allowed vlan &lt;VLAN_IDs&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>VLAN Pruning:</strong> VLAN pruning is a technique used to limit the number of VLANs that can travel over a trunk link. By default, a trunk port can carry traffic for all VLANs, but this can lead to unnecessary traffic and potential security risks. VLAN pruning ensures that only the VLANs required for a particular trunk link are allowed to send traffic across it.
How VLAN Pruning Works</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where you have three VLANs: VLAN 10, VLAN 20, and VLAN 30. Suppose you have two switches, Switch A and Switch B, connected via a trunk port. However, devices on Switch B only need access to VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. Without VLAN pruning, the trunk port would still carry traffic for VLAN 30, even though it&rsquo;s not needed on Switch B.</p>
<p>With VLAN pruning, you can configure the trunk port to only allow traffic for VLANs 10 and 20, effectively blocking VLAN 30 from using that trunk link. This reduces unnecessary traffic and minimizes the risk of VLAN hopping attacks, where an attacker could potentially access VLANs they&rsquo;re not supposed to.
Configuring VLAN Pruning</p>
<p>To configure VLAN pruning, you would typically specify which VLANs are allowed on a trunk port. Here’s an example command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, only VLANs 10 and 20 are allowed on the trunk link, while VLAN 30 is pruned off.</p>
<p><strong>Native VLAN:</strong> Ensure that the native VLAN (the VLAN for untagged traffic) is properly configured. Avoid using VLAN 1 as the native VLAN since it is the default and could be a target for attacks. Assign a different, unused VLAN as the native VLAN.
The Importance of Using an Unused VLAN for the Native VLAN</p>
<p>The native VLAN is the VLAN that carries untagged traffic on a trunk port. By default, this is VLAN 1, which can pose a security risk for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Target for Attacks:</strong> Since VLAN 1 is the default VLAN on most network devices, it is a common target for attackers. If an attacker gains access to VLAN 1, they could potentially disrupt or intercept untagged traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast Storms:</strong> Using VLAN 1 as the native VLAN increases the risk of broadcast storms, which can lead to network congestion and outages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Traffic:</strong> VLAN 1 often carries management traffic, making it more susceptible to being targeted in attacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Use an Unused VLAN</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it’s a best practice to assign an unused VLAN as the native VLAN. For example, if you have VLANs 10, 20, and 30 in use, you could assign VLAN 99 as the native VLAN:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk native vlan <span style="color:#ae81ff">99</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This approach reduces the risk of VLAN hopping and ensures that your critical VLANs are protected.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport trunk native vlan &lt;VLAN_ID&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Disable DTP: Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) can automatically negotiate trunking on a port. For security reasons, it&rsquo;s advisable to disable DTP and manually configure trunking to prevent unauthorized devices from becoming trunks.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport mode trunk
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>switchport nonegotiate
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Trunk ports are a fundamental component in VLAN-segmented networks, enabling the efficient and secure transport of traffic between switches and other network devices. By understanding the differences between trunk and access ports and following best practices for configuration, you can enhance both the performance and security of your network infrastructure. Remember, the goal is to maintain a streamlined, secure, and efficient network that meets the needs of your organization.</p>

            <description>VLAN stands for Virtual Local Area Network. Think of it as a way to segment a physical network into smaller, isolated parts without needing separate physical switches for each segment. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a bunch of invisible walls inside your network that can help organize and secure your traffic.
Why Use VLANs? Organization: Imagine your office building. Without VLANs, it’s like having no cubicles or offices—just one giant room where everyone’s talking over each other.</description>

<p>VLAN stands for <strong>Virtual Local Area Network</strong>. Think of it as a way to segment a physical network into smaller, isolated parts without needing separate physical switches for each segment. It&rsquo;s like having a bunch of invisible walls inside your network that can help organize and secure your traffic.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-vlans">Why Use VLANs?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Organization</strong>: Imagine your office building. Without VLANs, it’s like having no cubicles or offices—just one giant room where everyone’s talking over each other. With VLANs, you can separate departments (like HR, Sales, and IT) so each has its own space to communicate without interference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: VLANs add an extra layer of security by isolating sensitive data. For example, you can keep your HR department’s traffic separate from the rest of the network, reducing the risk of sensitive information leaking out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: By controlling and managing network traffic more effectively, VLANs can reduce congestion and improve overall performance. It’s like having dedicated lanes on a highway for different types of vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-vlans-work">How Do VLANs Work?</h3>
<p>In simple terms, VLANs tag network traffic with an identifier (VLAN ID) that tells your network devices how to handle it. Devices that belong to the same VLAN can communicate with each other as if they were on the same physical network, even if they’re not.</p>
<h3 id="real-life-example">Real-Life Example</h3>
<p>Let’s say you’re setting up a network for a small company. You could create one VLAN for the office staff, another for the guest Wi-Fi, and a third for the IP phones. This way, the guest Wi-Fi traffic doesn’t interfere with your office’s internal communications, and the IP phones have a dedicated path, ensuring call quality remains high.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>VLANs might sound a bit techy at first, but they’re a fundamental tool for creating a more organized, secure, and efficient network. Whether you&rsquo;re setting up a small home network or a large enterprise system, VLANs can make a big difference.</p>

<p>AI has become a significant force in the market, reshaping how people perceive technology. While I enjoy using AI models to craft images and descriptions for my D&amp;D group, immortalizing our adventures, my interaction with AI has been limited to this recreational use. Professionally, as a network engineer, my involvement with AI models is mostly limited to drawing inspiration from them for new ideas, or getting help rewording my emails and other communications. However, recently, I’ve delved into understanding how network design differs for AI farms and the rationale behind using different technologies or hardware setups.</p>
<h4 id="rdma">RDMA</h4>
<p>Let me introduce you to <strong>RDMA</strong>, which stands for Remote Direct Memory Access. RDMA bypasses the CPU and other traditional data access methods, pulling information directly from memory and transmitting it to the server array for model training. This technology is crucial as AI models are highly sensitive to packet loss, hence requiring a lossless approach. InfiniBand is another approach to this problem. While it’s intriguing, it relies on proprietary hardware not commonly found in most companies’ existing infrastructure. Consequently, setting up an AI deployment becomes significantly more expensive due to the need to acquire specific network hardware.</p>
<h4 id="roce">RoCE</h4>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a solution: <strong>RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet)</strong>. Essentially, RoCE offers the benefits of RDMA, such as bypassing the CPU and reducing latency, but can be implemented using existing Ethernet infrastructure. While this is an appealing option, there isn’t a standardized industry framework for it as far as I know. It remains to be seen which technology will prevail and steer the direction of the industry.</p>
<h4 id="comparing-technologies-and-connectivity-requirements">Comparing Technologies and Connectivity Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>InfiniBand (IB)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity Requirement</strong>: Layer 2</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: InfiniBand is a high-performance, low-latency networking technology primarily used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RoCE Versions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>RoCE v1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity Requirement</strong>: Layer 2</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: RoCE v1 relies on Ethernet frames and requires the network devices to be within the same Ethernet broadcast domain (i.e., the same VLAN/subnet).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RoCE v2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity Requirement</strong>: Layer 3</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: RoCE v2 encapsulates the RDMA traffic within UDP/IP packets, allowing it to traverse IP networks. This version supports layer 3 connectivity, meaning it can operate across different subnets and routed networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>I’m particularly interested in the infrastructure aspect of AI, which aligns closely with my career experiences. I’ll be closely monitoring developments in this area in the future. I’m looking forward to the day when I can set up a miniature version of these setups in my homelab and conduct real-world tests comparing the benefits of RoCE versus the classic Spine and Leaf design without AI-specific protocols. Given the rapid pace of industry evolution, that day might arrive sooner than expected.</p>
