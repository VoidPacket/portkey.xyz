      <description>VLAN stands for Virtual Local Area Network. Think of it as a way to segment a physical network into smaller, isolated parts without needing separate physical switches for each segment. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a bunch of invisible walls inside your network that can help organize and secure your traffic.&#xA;Why Use VLANs? Organization: Imagine your office building. Without VLANs, it’s like having no cubicles or offices—just one giant room where everyone’s talking over each other.</description>

      <description>AI has become a significant force in the market, reshaping how people perceive technology. While I enjoy using AI models to craft images and descriptions for my D&amp;amp;D group, immortalizing our adventures, my interaction with AI has been limited to this recreational use. Professionally, as a network engineer, my involvement with AI models is mostly limited to drawing inspiration from them for new ideas, or getting help rewording my emails and other communications.</description>
