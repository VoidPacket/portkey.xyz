      <description>In network engineering, the design of a network is pivotal to its efficiency, scalability, and reliability. Different types of network designs cater to various needs, from local area networks (LAN) to wide area networks (WAN). In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into several LAN designs, such as three-tier, collapsed core, campus, and spine-and-leaf architectures, as well as WAN designs like hub-and-spoke and mesh. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the pros and cons of each to help you make informed decisions for your network infrastructure.</description>

      <description>In the realm of network engineering, understanding the distinction between different types of ports is fundamental. Among these, trunk ports play a crucial role in managing network traffic efficiently and securely. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into what a trunk port is, how it differs from an access port, and its importance in network infrastructure. We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover best practices for configuring trunk ports to ensure optimal security and performance.</description>

      <title>What Is a VLAN</title>

      <description>VLAN stands for Virtual Local Area Network. Think of it as a way to segment a physical network into smaller, isolated parts without needing separate physical switches for each segment. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a bunch of invisible walls inside your network that can help organize and secure your traffic.&#xA;Why Use VLANs? Organization: Imagine your office building. Without VLANs, it’s like having no cubicles or offices—just one giant room where everyone’s talking over each other.</description>

      <description>AI has become a significant force in the market, reshaping how people perceive technology. While I enjoy using AI models to craft images and descriptions for my D&amp;amp;D group, immortalizing our adventures, my interaction with AI has been limited to this recreational use. Professionally, as a network engineer, my involvement with AI models is mostly limited to drawing inspiration from them for new ideas, or getting help rewording my emails and other communications.</description>
