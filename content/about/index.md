Hello! I’m Bryan Wassel, a passionate network engineer with over 15 years of experience in the IT industry, including more than 6 years specializing in Network Engineering. I have a knack for making complex systems simple and reliable, and I’ve had the pleasure of working on a variety of exciting projects that have sharpened my skills and expanded my knowledge.

At Portkey, my goal is to create a space where people can learn and explore different topics in network engineering. I believe that learning is a continuous journey, and through this blog, I aim to share insights, tips, and trends in the world of networking.

Outside of networking, I hold a partial ownership in a local brewery, offering my expertise in an advisory capacity. When I’m not engaged with network systems or the brewery, you’ll likely find me diving into new tech, reading a good book, or enjoying quality moments with family and friends.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find the content here helpful and engaging!
