Hello! I’m Bryan Wassel, a passionate network engineer with a knack for making complex systems simple and reliable. With over 6 years of experience in networking and network security, I’ve had the pleasure of working on a variety of exciting projects that have sharpened my skills and expanded my knowledge.

At Portkey, my goal is to share insights, tips, and trends in the world of network engineering. I believe that learning is a continuous journey, and through this blog, I aim to create a community where we can all grow together. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting out, there’s something here for everyone.

When I’m not tinkering with networks, you might find me exploring new technologies, enjoying a good book, or spending quality time with family and friends.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find the content here helpful and engaging!
